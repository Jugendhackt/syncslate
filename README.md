## Introduction
### Problem
Recording videos is as easy as can be, however, editing can simply be a pain.
However, editing videos often is a pain in messy video editing software.

### Solution
Therefore, syncslate allows to automatically cut videos that were recorded
with [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/), short OBS. 

### Principle
Simply select a video file, as well as a keystone file created by the OBS plugin
[*InfoWriter*](https://github.com/partouf/OBSInfoWriter). That's it!

## Requirements
These libraries and plugins are needed to run syncslate.
* [OBSInfoWriter](https://github.com/partouf/OBSInfoWriter)
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
