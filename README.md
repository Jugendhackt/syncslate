## Introduction
### Problem
Recording videos is as easy as can be, however, editing can be a pain when dealing with messy video editing software.

### Solution
Therefore, syncslate allows to automatically cut videos that were recorded
with [*Open Broadcaster Software*](https://obsproject.com/), short OBS. 

### Principle
Simply select a video file, as well as a keystone file created by the OBS plugin
[*InfoWriter*](https://github.com/partouf/OBSInfoWriter). That's it!

## Capabilities
